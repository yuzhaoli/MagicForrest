/**
 * This class represents a node.
 * <p>
 * Nodes consist of the ten fixed nodes (the ten icons on the perimeter of the
 * board), and nine tiles (the nine tiles that may be placed in the center of
 * board.
 * <p>
 * The 25 positions with their position numbers:
 * <p>
 *   0  1  2  3  4
 *   5  6  7  8  9
 *   10 11 12 13 14
 *   15 16 17 18 19
 *   20 21 22 23 24
 * <p>
 * Tiles may be placed in any of the nine positions depicted below:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 *   6  7  8
 *   11 12 13
 *   16 17 18
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The 10 fixed icons are located at positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 15, 19, 21 and 23.
 * The four corner positions (0, 4, 20, 24) are unoccupied, as are positions 14 and
 * 22.   The following diagram illustrates the locations of the 10 fixed icons,
 * which have character codes 'Q' ... 'Z' (see the Icon class for more info).
 * Permanently unoccupied positions are marked '.'.
